Vue.js ToDo App
A dynamic and interactive ToDo application built with Vue.js that demonstrates core frontend development skills. Features include:

Adding, editing, and deleting todos

Filtering todos by status (All, Active, Completed)

Real-time UI updates using Vueâ€™s reactive data binding

Form validation for user input

Responsive and accessible design with clear visual feedback

Deployed live on Netlify for easy access and demonstration

This project highlights my ability to build clean, maintainable, and user-friendly web applications using modern frontend frameworks and best practices.

plans to add new features such as: local storage, prioritising todos by being able to move them up and down the list
